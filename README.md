## Quick Start

### Development Setup (Recommended)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the WebSocket server (backend):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:server
   ```
   This starts the Express server with WebSocket support on port 3000.

3. **Start the development server (frontend):**
   ```bash
   npx vite --port 3001
   ```
   This starts the Vite dev server on port 3001.

4. **Access the applications:**
   - **Teacher Interface**: `http://localhost:3001/`

   - **Teacher Interface**: `http://localhost:3000/`
   - **Student Interface**: `http://localhost:3000/student.html`

## System Architecture

### Server Setup
- **Express Server** (Port 3000): WebSocket server + static file hosting
- **Vite Dev Server** (Port 3001): Development server with hot reload
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Real-time communication between teacher and students

### Client Setup
- **Teacher Device**: Runs the main application with speech recognition
- **Student Devices**: Run the student interface to receive captions

2. **Start Recording**: Click "Start" to begin speech recognition
3. **Speak**: Your speech appears as live captions and broadcasts to students
4. **Manage**: Use pause, clear, and download features as needed

### Student Setup
1. **Open Student Interface**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3001/student.html`
2. **Automatic Connection**: Students automatically connect to the WebSocket server
3. **Receive Captions**: Captions appear in real-time as the teacher speaks
4. **Reconnection**: If connection is lost, students automatically reconnect

### Translation Features (Teacher Only)
1. **Click Words**: Click any word in the transcript
2. **View Translation**: Thai translation appears in a popover
3. **Save Words**: Click "Save Word" to add to your vocabulary list
4. **Access Vocabulary**: Use the purple sidebar button to view saved words

### Keyboard Shortcuts (Teacher)
